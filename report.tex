The student submits a 10-page report (NSERC format) reviewing the literature corresponding to the summary and the corpus of articles. The bibliography, title, and summary are not included in the page count. Figures, code snippets, algorithms, or summary tables are allowed in the appendix and do not count towards the page limit. The student may consult with their research supervisor for guidance on writing the report. Several resources are also available. See, for example, https://www.uk.sagepub.com/books/Book236719
